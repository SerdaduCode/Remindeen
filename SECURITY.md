This page informs visitors regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for those who choose to use Remindeen.

### Information Collection and Use

- **GeoLocation Data**
    GeoLocation DataRemindeen does not store geolocation data. We only detect the userâ€™s location to fetch accurate prayer times using external APIs. The detected location is sent to the following APIs for retrieving relevant prayer times:

    - [Aladhan API](https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timings) for prayer times

    - [Nominatim OpenStreetMap](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse) for location lookup

- **Religious Content Display**  
  Remindeen does not store any user data. We only display selected verses from the Quran, hadiths, quotes, and pictures from SerdaduCode APIs. The content is fetched dynamically from external sources and is not linked to any specific user data.

### Service Providers

Remindeen relies on our backend API service, hosted in the cloud, to fetch religious content. The source code for this service is available on GitHub: [Remindeen API](https://github.com/Dhyoga/al-quotes).

### Security

We value user trust in providing their information and strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify users of any updates by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of **2024-03-08**.
